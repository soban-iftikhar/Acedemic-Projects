Operating System Concepts - Multithreading Edge Cases Test
This file is for demonstrating multithreading and threads in action.
Each thread will count a portion of the statistics with precision.

Threads: The Foundation of Parallelism
Modern operating systems rely heavily on threads to manage concurrent execution.
Multiple threads can execute simultaneously, sharing the same memory space.
We must use mutex locks to ensure accurate counts when threads access shared resources.

Edge Case 1: Beginning of File
threads appear at the start of sentences and in the middle of threads.
Threads (capitalized) should not match because search is case-sensitive.
Thread management is crucial for performance.

Edge Case 2: Multiple Occurrences Per Line
threads threads threads appear three times consecutively here.
The word threads should be counted each time it appears threads independently threads here.

Edge Case 3: Empty Lines and Whitespace


Edge Case 4: Single Character Lines
a
I
x

Edge Case 5: Punctuation and Special Characters
threads, threads. threads! threads?
"threads" (in quotes) and 'threads' (in single quotes).
threads:the;threads-critical;threads.important

Edge Case 6: Very Long Line
This is a very long line that contains the word threads multiple times: threads appears here, threads appears there, and threads appears everywhere in this comprehensive test line designed to verify that word counting works correctly across extended content.

Edge Case 7: Words Containing Search Term
threading is not threads because it contains extra characters.
freeThreads, unthreads, and mythreads are not pure thread matches.
threadsafe is not the same as threads alone.

Edge Case 8: End of File
The final line demonstrates threads at the end of document.
Last occurrence: threads.
